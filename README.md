# Printer
I printed on a Bambu X1C, but the swerve modules should be printable even on an A1 Mini.
The total print time is approx 66 hours on my X1C with a 0.4 mm nozzle, using approx 1.8kg when printing with the "0.2 Strength" preset.
Strength is probably not needed for all parts, but the main swerve swivelling part with the print-in-place bearing probably needs it at least.
